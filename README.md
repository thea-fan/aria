# User Experience
1. Problem Statement
  - Most reflective moments in a person's day tend to be the few moment before one sleeps. However, grabbing a pen and paper to jot it down is just not realistic. 
  - Alternative is to use a note-taking app to type one's notes and reflection down. The problem is that typing is relatively slow and user might lose train of thoughts easily.
2. User Persona
  - Users with habits of phone-usage prior to sleep (age: 18-35)
  - Frequent journal user and note-takers who value day-planning and benefit of reflections 
3. User flow 
  - Think and reflect on one's day
  - Plan for the next day
  - Record notes (voice-to-text or pure audio)
  - Edit voice-to-text notes if necessary
  - Check off / delete notes whenever accomplished
